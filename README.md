# Arcade Prize Dispenser

Awarded 3rd Place in UNLV's Spring 2025 Junior Design Competition

Sure, winning arcade games is fun and all, but the REAL point of every arcade is to win amazing prizes! With this project, we will design our own prize dispensing machine.

## Overview

This project implements an arcade-style vending machine using an ATmega328PB and peripherals including an RFID scanner, LCD module, servo motors, buttons, variable voltage regulator, and logic level shifter. 

It demonstrates my foundational understanding of hardware, software, and soft skills essential for embedded systems engineering.
