## Project Abstract
Sure, winning arcade games is fun and all, but the REAL point of every arcade is to win amazing prizes! With this project, we will design our own prize dispensing machine utilizing the ATmega328p as the brain of the project. Additional components for this project will be a 16x2 LCD Module, RFID scanner, keypad, and servos. Our machine will be able to read account & card balance, read prize selection input, dispense prizes according to selection, and adjust card balance on local arcade server. There will also be a simple math game (not in the machine) for increasing the card balance.
